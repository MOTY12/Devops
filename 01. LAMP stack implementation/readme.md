EC2 means elastic compute cloud. it is a virtual server that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.

## Prerequisites
In order to proceed, I believe the reader have a AWS account because you will need an AWS account and a virtual server with Ubuntu Server OS else <a href="https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup">click here</a> to create an account. Stay calm and Let makes our hands dirty.

Let create a virtual server and install a ubuntu OS on it. To create an instance below is the process.

Firstly, we log on to our account, create an ec2 instance, install ubuntu OS and save your key pair(.pem) securely. <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchcloudcomputing/tutorial/How-to-create-an-EC2-instance-from-AWS-Console">click here</a> for more details. or follow this below
