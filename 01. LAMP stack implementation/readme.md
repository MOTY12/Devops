## WEB STACK IMPLEMENTATION (LAMP STACK) IN AWS
<p>In this article, you will learn how to implement LAMP stack on aws</p>

## Overview
LAMP is an acronym of four software technologies that developers used for building website and web application. It is denoted from <b>LINUX</b> an operating system, <b>Apache</b> a web server, <b>mySQL</b> a database server, and <b>PHP, python, perl</b> a server-side programming language. LAMP is a stack 

AWS means Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a secure cloud services platform, offering compute power, database storage and it helps Running  web and application servers in the cloud to host dynamic websites. I'll be using a cloud server called <b>Ec2 server </b>  which will enables us to use a virtual server and it offers a free tier account that we are going to leverage on for this projects.

EC2 means elastic compute cloud. it is a virtual server that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.

Apache server

Security group acts as a firewall that controls the traffic allowed to and from the resources in your virtual private cloud (VPC).

## Prerequisites
In order to proceed, I believe the reader have a AWS account because you will need an AWS account and a virtual server with Ubuntu Server OS else <a href="https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup">click here</a> to create an account. Stay calm and Let makes our hands dirty.

## Create a Ec2 instance
Let create a virtual server and install a ubuntu OS on it. To create an instance below is the process.

Firstly, we log on to our account, create an ec2 instance, install ubuntu OS and save your key pair(.pem) securely. <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchcloudcomputing/tutorial/How-to-create-an-EC2-instance-from-AWS-Console">click here</a> for more details. or follow this below

After,  a Ec2 instance is created then let connect to the instance.
if you are using windows you connect using a tools called putty and mac users use there terminal to connect into their instance using SSH command. I'm a mac user <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/putty.html">Click here</a> for windows user. 

## Connect to Ec2 instance
a. Open terminal and locate the downloaded key pair file using this linux command `cd` and your file directory.

```bash
$ cd Downloads
```

b. Change premissions for the private key file, otherwise you can get an error

```bash
$ chmod 400 <private_file.pem>
```

c. Connect to the instance
```bash
$ ssh -i <private-key-name>.pem ubuntu@<Public-IP-address>
```

## Install Apache and update firewall

To install apache server we will use the Ubuntu package manager `apt`

```bash
#update a list of packages in package manager
sudo apt update

#run apache2 package installation
sudo apt install apache2
```
To ensure the apache2 is installed, use

```bash
sudo systemctl status apache2
```
If the below image is your result then you are on the track. You have launched your web server.

Let update the firewall by configuring our security group inbound rules on ec2 instance.

## Configure EC2 instance  security inbound rules

When the instance is created, we have a default TCP rule on port 22 opened which is useful for SSH connection to a terminal. In order to ensure that our webpage are being accessed on the internet, we need to open a TCP port 80 inbound rule.

To check the accessiblity of our web server on the internet, we curl the IP address/DNS name of our localhost.

```bash
 curl http://localhost:80
or
 curl http://127.0.0.1:80 
```

<img src="./Images/Screenshot 2023-08-23 at 22.22.20.png">

To see if our web application server can respond to requests , use the public ip address of our instance on a web browser. http://<Public_IP_Address>:80 or without the port 'http://<Public_IP_Address>'

## Installing mysql
To install mysql server we use the command below

```bash
$ sudo apt install mysql-server
```

## Installing PHP
To install PHP, these 3 package need to be installed together
```bash
$ sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql
```
once the installation is done used the command below to ensure it is installed and check the version 

```bash
$ php -v
```

## Deploy your PHP website

Create a new directory <directory_name>

```bash
$ sudo mkdir /var/www/<directory_name>
```

Assign ownership of the directory with your current system user
```bash
$ sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/<directory_name>
```

Create and open a new configuration file in Apacheâ€™s sites-available directory using your preferred command-line editor

```bash
$ sudo vi /etc/apache2/sites-available/<directory_name>.conf
```

The command above will create a new file and you will paste this code in it 

```bash
$ <VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName proj<directory_name>ectlamp
    ServerAlias <directory_name> 
    ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
    DocumentRoot /var/www/<directory_name>
    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```

To save and close the file, simply follow the steps below:
<ul>
<li>Hit the esc button on the keyboard</li>
<li>Type :</li>
<li>Type wq. w for write and q for quit</li>
<li>Hit ENTER to save the file</li>
</ul>

You can use `ls` to list the document in the directory 

Run esc :wq  to save and terminate vi editor.

Run `sudo a2ensite projectlampstack` to activate the server block.

Run `sudo a2dissite 000-default` to deactivate the default webserver block that comes with apache on default.

Reload the apache2 server `sudo systemctl reload apache2`


Create a index file inside you directory `/var/www/<folder_name>`
```bash
$ cd /var/www/<folder_name>
$ touch index.html
```

Write your html code into the file using `sudo vi <filename>``
```bash
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>01. LAMP stack implementation</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>hello world</h1>
</body>
</html>
```
To save and close the file, simply follow the steps below:
<ul>
<li>Hit the esc button on the keyboard</li>
<li>Type :</li>
<li>Type wq!</li>
<li>Hit ENTER to save the file</li>
</ul>

Go to your browser and try to open your website URL using your public IP address:

`http://<Public-IP-Address>:80` or `http://<Public-IP-Address>`

<h3>Enable PHP on the website</h3>

By default, in Apache, if both an index.html and an index.php file exist in a directory, the server will prioritize displaying the index.html file over the index.php file. This feature can be advantageous when configuring maintenance pages for PHP applications. You can achieve this by temporarily creating an index.html file with informative content for visitors. Since the index.html page takes precedence over the index.php page, it becomes the primary landing page for your application during maintenance. Once the maintenance work is completed, you can either rename or delete the index.html file from the document root, restoring the regular application page.

If you wish to modify this behavior and give priority to the index.php file, you'll need to edit the `/etc/apache2/mods-enabled/dir.conf file`. Inside this file, you can adjust the order in which the index.php file is listed within the DirectoryIndex directive.

```bash
$ sudo vim /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/dir.conf
```


```bash
<IfModule mod_dir.c>
     #Change this:
    #DirectoryIndex index.html index.cgi index.pl index.php index.xhtml index.htm
    #To this:
    DirectoryIndex index.php index.html index.cgi index.pl index.xhtml index.htm
</IfModule>
```

After we save the file then we need to reload the Apache

```bash
$ sudo systemctl reload apache2
```

Create a php file to test if php is setup correctly and configured 

```bash
$ vim /var/www/<folder_name>/index.php
```

Write your php code and save. Below is a sample code 

```bash
<?php
phpinfo();
```

Go to your browser and open your website URL using your public IP address:

```bash
http://<Public-IP-Address>:80 or http://<Public-IP-Address>
```


Congratulations on successfully deploying your LAMP stack on AWS! You've achieved a significant milestone.
